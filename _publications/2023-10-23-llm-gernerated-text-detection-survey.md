title: "A survey on llm-gernerated text detection: Necessity, methods, and future directions"
collection: llm-gernerated text detection

excerpt: 'The powerful ability to understand, follow, and generate complex language emerging from large language models (LLMs) makes LLM-generated text flood many areas of our daily
lives at an incredible speed and is widely accepted by humans. As LLMs continue to expand,
there is an imperative need to develop detectors that can detect LLM-generated text. This is
crucial to mitigate potential misuse of LLMs and safeguard realms like artistic expression and social networks from harmful influence of LLM-generated content. The LLM-generated text
detection aims to discern if a piece of text was produced by an LLM, which is essentially
a binary classification task. The detector techniques have witnessed notable advancements recently, propelled by innovations in watermarking techniques, statistics-based detectors, neuralbase detectors, and human-assisted methods. In this survey, we collate recent research breakthroughs in this area and underscore the pressing need to bolster detector research. We also delve into prevalent datasets, elucidating their limitations and developmental requirements.
Furthermore, we analyze various LLM-generated text detection paradigms, shedding light on
challenges like out-of-distribution problems, potential attacks, real-world data issues and the
lack of effective evaluation framework. Conclusively, we highlight interesting directions for
future research in LLM-generated text detection to advance the implementation of responsible
artificial intelligence (AI). Our aim with this survey is to provide a clear and comprehensive
introduction for newcomers while also offering seasoned researchers a valuable update in the
field of LLM-generated text detection. '
