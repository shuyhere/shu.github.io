I am **Shu Yang**, a incoming Ph.D. student in Computer Science at King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST) starting from Fall 2024. I am very fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Di Wang](https://shao3wangdi.github.io/) in PRADA Lab (Provable Responsible AI and Data Analytics Lab). Before that, I received my Master's degree in Computational Linguistics from the University of Macau, where I was advised by [Derek F. Wong](https://www.fst.um.edu.mo/personal/derek-wong/).

My research interests include Explainable AI, Alignment of Large Language Models, and Synthetic Data. I am committed to developing AI systems that are interpretable, ensuring that large models align with human values and effectively utilize synthetic data. My goal is to contribute to the creation of AI that is environmentally friendly, human-friendly, fair, and sustainable.

Additionally, my husband and I are running a startup, dedicated to providing controllable and secure AI software. Stay tuned for our upcoming products!
I am looking for some collaborators. Please do not hesitate to contact me if you are interested.
