I am **Shu Yang**, a incoming Ph.D. student in Computer Science at King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST) starting from Fall 2024. I am very fortunate to be advised by [**Prof. Di Wang**](https://shao3wangdi.github.io/) in PRADA Lab (Provable Responsible AI and Data Analytics Lab). Before that, I received my Master's degree in Computational Linguistics from the University of Macau, where I was advised by **Prof. Derek Wong**.

I am looking for some collaborators. Please do not hesitate to contact me if you are interested.

Additionally, my husband and I are running a startup, dedicated to providing controllable and secure AI software. Stay tuned for our upcoming products!
